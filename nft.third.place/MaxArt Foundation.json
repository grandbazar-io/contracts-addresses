    "description": "MaxArt Foundation for Support and Development of Contemporary Art was established in 2021 by the Russian artist Evgenia Voronova and partners. The Foundation pursues the mission of promoting contemporary art in Russia. Its core activities focus on connecting and supporting promising young artists as well as crafting educational programs for aspiring collectors and for anybody interested in art who wants to be aware of the current context. The main feature of exhibitions organized by the Foundation is that experimental site-specific projects are shown at locations and venues where exhibition of art is not the original primary function.",
