    "description": "Double portrait de Jeanne Baudot\n\nA pupil of the painter and godmother of his son Jean. Remained in the family.\n\n1896, oil on canvas\nHand signed by artist\n25 × 40.5 cm\n9 4/5 × 15 9/10 cm\nExhibited:\n•  Renoir in-me, Paris, Galerie Durand-Ruel, January 7th - February 8th, 1969.\n•  Renoir et ses amis. Cinquantenaire de la mort de Renoir,1919-1969, Troyes, Musée des Beaux-arts de  Troyes, June 28th - Septembre 14th, 1969.\n•  De Renoir à Vuillard, Musée promenade de Marly-le-Roi, Marly-le-Roi, Louveciennes, March 22th - June  24th 1984.\n\nThis year Renoir made a portrait of me wearing a red and green hat, he presented both my profile and en face portrait on the same canvas. On the right sketch, he had applied a touch of varnish mixed with poppy seed oil and he told me: “Remember this technique, as you more than I will have the possibility of seeing its effect. And it is true that the painting never changed.“\n\nRenoir met Jeanne Baudot in 1893, and this painting is presumed to have been executed, in 1896. At that time Renoir was already reknown and admired. His uncommon technique will later become an inspiration for great masters such as Pablo Picasso, Pierre Bonnard, and Maurice Denis.In this painting, the female body is approached in a very intimate manner. The finesse and precision of the execution is a result of Renoir's stage at a ceramic decorating studio when he was a young man. We can note the elegance of the model's delicate, ivory skin, as well as the nuances of color and light in Baudot's gown and hat.",
