    "description": "MYTH Gallery is a contemporary art gallery in St.Petersburg that opened in May 2019. The key direction of our practice is the acquaintance of professional and wide audience with works of young Russian artists. Primarily the gallery aims to support the development of young Russian art: artists who are at the beginning of their careers. The gallery carries out both personal and group curatorial projects in order to support young curators. We strongly believe that young curators are those specialists who change the environment and take artists to a higher professional level. Among our goals is the formation of a new generation of collectors, with whom the gallery plans long-term and fruitful cooperation. We understand the importance of being present on the international art scene, therefore participation in international fairs and exhibitions is one of the important vectors of the gallery's development.",
